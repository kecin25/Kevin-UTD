bool check Down/UP (string for the file line)
int Check Direction (string for the file line)
int Check Distance (string for the file line)
bool check Bold (string for the file line)
bool check Print (string for the file line)



*main

Open the input file

open output file

make two arrays that will be 50x50

these arrays will be linked to the output file



make a loop that does two things
1)gets the cmds line by line and runs it through part 2
2)checks Direction, Distance, if the pen is up or down, if Bold, and if Print

if the pen is down print out to the file the distance and direction and if bold, bold

if print is true
{ loop that prints out the grid and rows}

close input file

close output file

if possible open output file for user to see

*check Down/UP

read up to the first comma and ignore the rest

if 1 pen is up and do not print
	return false

if 2 pen is down and do print
	return true


*check direction (string for the file line)

delete up to the first comma and read up to the 2nd comma

series of if statments that check to see if the char is N,E,S,or W. then corosponds that to 1-4.

returns the number 1-4


*check distance (string for the file line)

delete up to the 2nd comma and then read up the the potiental third.
if there is a comma read up to that
if no comma read till the null terminator

looks to see how large the distance is and returns that number

*Bold (string for the file line)
check to see if there is a third comma if not return false, if there is check to see if Bold needs to be true


*Print (string for the file line)
check to see if there is a third comma, if yes then check to see if it is a B or a P, if B check for a fourth comma. if no fourth comma then return false,
 if after third comma is a P then return true
if true then print using X,Y cordnate system that corrosponds to the 50x50
