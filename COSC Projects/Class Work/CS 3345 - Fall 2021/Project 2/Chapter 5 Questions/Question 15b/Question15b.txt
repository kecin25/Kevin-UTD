Suppose we want to find the first occurrence of a string P1P2 ··· Pk in a long input
string A1A2 ··· AN. We can solve this problem by hashing the pattern string, obtaining a hash value HP, and comparing this value with the hash value formed from
A1A2 ··· Ak, A2A3 ··· Ak+1, A3A4 ··· Ak+2, and so on until AN−k+1AN−k+2 ··· AN.
If we have a match of hash values, we compare the strings character by character
to verify the match. We return the position (in A) if the strings actually do match,
and we continue in the unlikely event that the match is false.

Show that the running time is O(k + N) plus the time spent refuting false
matches
