a) 
	XOR the inputs of A and B together so that A0 XOR B0 .... A31 XOR B31. Then NOR the outputs of the XOR gates to find if the two inputs are even.
	For sketch look at Question 5.PNG
b)
	Not all B inputs, then and all As with all Bs. Then or everything together to see if A>B.

c)
	Not the A inputs, then And the Not As and the Bs. Or those outputs together and then Or that with the Equal ouput from part A to get Less Than or Equal.
