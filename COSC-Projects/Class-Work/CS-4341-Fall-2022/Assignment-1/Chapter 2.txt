Exercise 2.36 A priority encoder has 2N inputs. It produces an N-bit binary
output indicating the most significant bit of the input that is TRUE, or 0 if none of
the inputs are TRUE. It also produces an output NONE that is TRUE if none of
the inputs are TRUE. Design an eight-input priority encoder with inputs A7:0 and
outputs Y2.0 and NONE. For example, if the input is 00100000, the output Y
should be 101 and NONE should be 0. Give a simplified Boolean equation for
each output, and sketch a schematic.
	For my output I Have Y1.4 to Y1.1 to represent each each bit of the Y1 output (ex Y1.4=0,Y1.3=1,Y1.2=1,Y1.1=1 equals 0111 or 7)
	Y1.4 = A
	Y1.3 = A'E+A'B'D+A'DF+A'C+A'B'D+A'BG'+A'B'H
	Y1.2 = A'D'E'G+A'D'E'F+A'C+A'B
	Y1.1 = A'C'E'G'H+A'C'E'F+A'C'D+A'B
	Y2 = A'B'C'D'E'F'G'H'
