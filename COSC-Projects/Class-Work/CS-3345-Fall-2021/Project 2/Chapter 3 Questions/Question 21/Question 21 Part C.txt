To print out an error message that will help the user find the probable cause, I kept a counter of what line each object pushed is on. Doing this when my program prints out an error message
I am able to tell the user what line the error is occuring. In the test.txt file there is an error on line 3 because there is a missing '{'. The program tells the user there is an error on line 3 because 
it is missing a '{'.
