a. Find a minimum spanning tree for the graph in Figure 9.84 using both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms
b. Is this minimum spanning tree unique? why?
	yes, because just looking at Prim's algorithm you will get a different minimum spanning tree at each location you start at. Starting at position A instead of B will make A and E connected instead of 
	B and E. Kruskal's algorithm can give several minimum spanning trees based on different implementations. when finding the smallest edge using > instead of >= will make a difference on the outcome of the
	tree.
