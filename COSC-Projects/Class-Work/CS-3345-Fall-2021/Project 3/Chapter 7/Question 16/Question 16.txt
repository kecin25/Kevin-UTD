How would you impllement mergesort without using recursion?

Answer:

I would use a series of for loops.
First thing I would do is compare two parts of the array and switch them if needed, for example I would compare 0 and 1 then compare 2 and 3, and so forth until I hit the end of the array.
next I would use a set of nested for loops that will compare these "blocks" and using two pointers one for each block compare numbers and switch when needed, keeping track of the smaller number and moving
the pointer for the bigger number until both have reached the end of their block.
I would then do this again using the nested loop to compare the next set of blocks until all blocks of size 2 or 1 have been compared and sorted. 
Now I would make these block sizes be sizes of 4 and repeat this proccess until the block size is the same size as the array.
